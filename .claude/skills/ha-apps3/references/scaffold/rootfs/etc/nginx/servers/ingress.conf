        # CUSTOMIZE: Handling apps that embed absolute paths in HTML responses
        #
        # HA ingress mounts the add-on under a dynamic path prefix
        # (e.g. /api/hassio_ingress/<token>/).  The prefix is available in two ways:
        #
        #   1. X-Ingress-Path header (preferred) — forwarded by proxy_params.conf.
        #      Configure the app to read this header or the APP_BASE_URL env var
        #      (set by 10-app-setup.sh) to construct correct absolute URLs itself.
        #      Most modern frameworks support a ROOT_PATH / BASE_URL setting.
        #
        #   2. nginx sub_filter rewriting (fallback) — uncomment the block below
        #      only when the app cannot be configured to use a base path at all.
        #      nginx rewrites absolute paths in HTML/CSS/JS responses on the fly.
        #      Note: sub_filter rewrites are CPU-intensive and may miss dynamic JS.
        #

        # sub_filter_once  off;
