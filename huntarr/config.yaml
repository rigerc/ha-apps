  Automatic missing content hunter for Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, and
  Whisparr. Continuously searches your media libraries for missing content
  and quality upgrades below your cutoff. Runs continuously while being gentle
  on your indexers, filling the gap that *arr apps don't cover by finding
  content not actively searched through RSS feeds.
